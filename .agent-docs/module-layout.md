# Module layout

How files under `src/` are organized and how that organization maps to the public `sundry.*` namespace.

## File path = namespace path

The framework ([core/mk-lib.nix](../core/mk-lib.nix)) walks every `.nix` file under `src/` and exposes its attributes (minus `tests`) at `sundry.<dirname>`, where `<dirname>` is the file's directory relative to `src/`. The filename itself is dropped.

| File | Exports at | Function ends up at |
|---|---|---|
| [src/vfs/dir/reform.nix](../src/vfs/dir/reform.nix) | `sundry.vfs.dir` | `sundry.vfs.dir.reform` |
| [src/vfs/dir/filter.nix](../src/vfs/dir/filter.nix) | `sundry.vfs.dir` | `sundry.vfs.dir.filter`, `sundry.vfs.dir.filter-within-tag` |
| [src/vfs/dir/load-nix.nix](../src/vfs/dir/load-nix.nix) | `sundry.vfs.dir` | `sundry.vfs.dir.load-nix`, `sundry.vfs.dir.load-nix-with` |
| [src/vfs/dir/select.nix](../src/vfs/dir/select.nix) | `sundry.vfs.dir` | `sundry.vfs.dir.select-by-tag` |
| [src/vfs/file/get-tag-pos.nix](../src/vfs/file/get-tag-pos.nix) | `sundry.vfs.file` | `sundry.vfs.file.get-tag-pos` |
| [src/boolean/operands/tag.nix](../src/boolean/operands/tag.nix) | `sundry.boolean.operands` | `sundry.boolean.operands.tag`, `sundry.boolean.operands.deepest-tag` |
| [src/vfs/tag/faceted-match.nix](../src/vfs/tag/faceted-match.nix) | `sundry.vfs.tag` | `sundry.vfs.tag.faceted-match` |
| [src/list/permutations.nix](../src/list/permutations.nix) | `sundry.list` | `sundry.list.permutations` |

Pick the filename to match what's inside: a single function gets the function's name; a cohesive cluster gets a name describing the cluster.

Each module receives the shared library arguments (`sundry`, `lib`, `pkgs`, and `flake-root` as needed) and returns an attrset of exports. `flake-root` is a path (`./.` from the flake); build a location with `flake-root + "/path"`, never `"${flake-root}/path"`, since interpolating a path copies the tree to the store (see [gotchas.md](gotchas.md#store-path-context-survives-string-operations)). The assembly is a lazy fixed point, so modules may call other `sundry.*` functions regardless of filesystem discovery order. `tests` is the one reserved top-level attribute: the framework removes it from public exports. Two modules may contribute different attributes to one namespace, but the assembly throws if they export the same terminal attribute path.

## When to split, when to keep together

The criterion is cohesion, not file count. Keep things together when they're uniform — same input shape, same return shape, same test fixture, same conceptual domain. Reading the file should require holding **one** mental model. Split when it requires two.

Cohesive clusters that live in one file:

- [src/vfs/path/getters.nix](../src/vfs/path/getters.nix) — `get.{name, stem, ext, str}`, facets of one object.
- [src/vfs/path/setters.nix](../src/vfs/path/setters.nix) — `set.{name, stem, ext}`, the mirror of `get`; reuses the getters to round-trip a path's name.
- [src/list/accessors.nix](../src/list/accessors.nix) — `at`, `incl-init`/`incl-tail`, `excl-last`/`excl-head`; list-edge accessors, same shape.
- [src/str/find-after.nix](../src/str/find-after.nix) — `find-after` and `rfind-after`, mirror functions.
- [src/str/trim.nix](../src/str/trim.nix) — `trim`, `trim-left`, `trim-right`, same shape.
- [src/attrs/compare.nix](../src/attrs/compare.nix) — `compare` and `compare-until` (the latter is a generalization).

Related operations still belong in separate files when their callback and result contracts differ. The VFS traversal specializations are split into [reform.nix](../src/vfs/dir/reform.nix), [filter.nix](../src/vfs/dir/filter.nix), [collapse.nix](../src/vfs/dir/collapse.nix), and [walk.nix](../src/vfs/dir/walk.nix); each file owns one operation family and its tests.

The split usually pays off when the test block, not the function block, is what's making the file hard to read.

## Where helpers live

A helper goes in the namespace whose domain it operates on, not in the namespace that happens to call it. [src/vfs/file/get-tag-pos.nix](../src/vfs/file/get-tag-pos.nix) walks a file's `tag-list`, so it lives in `vfs/file/` next to the node fields it reads — not wherever it happens to be called from. [src/vfs/tag/faceted-match.nix](../src/vfs/tag/faceted-match.nix) is consumed only by the [`tag` and `deepest-tag`](../src/boolean/operands/tag.nix) boolean operands, yet lives in `vfs/tag/`, not `boolean/` — it is *about* a tag-set matched against a tag-spec, and knows nothing about boolean expressions. Co-locating with the data type beats co-locating with the consumer.

The domain is the side of the signature the function is *about*, not the argument or return type mechanically. [src/vfs/path/from-str.nix](../src/vfs/path/from-str.nix) (`string → path`) and `get.str` (`path → string`) both live in `vfs/path/`, though one takes and the other returns a plain string — `path` is what each is about, `string` is just raw material. By contrast [src/str/to-segments.nix](../src/str/to-segments.nix) (empty-aware split, `sep → string → [string]`) knows nothing about paths, so it lives in `str/`; `from-str` reuses it and adds the path-specific `/` and trim. Ask "what type is this *about*?" — not "what type is in the signature?".

## Renaming / restructuring

A split or move usually shifts the public namespace. Check call sites with `rg` first; internal-only callers update in the same commit, external consumers need a deprecation path.
