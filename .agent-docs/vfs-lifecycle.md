# VFS lifecycle

VFS operations transform trees of the node shapes defined in [data-model.md](data-model.md). They represent the logical VFS path separately from a leaf's physical `origin`.

## Constructors return trees

[`file.from-text`](../src/vfs/file/from-text.nix) and [`file.from-src`](../src/vfs/file/from-src.nix) return a one-file tree created with `lib.setAttrByPath`, not a bare leaf:

```nix
sundry.vfs.file.from-text ["A" "B.txt"] "contents"
# => { A."B.txt" = { text = "contents"; }; }
```

Both require a non-empty VFS path. `from-text` adds `text`; `from-src` reads the physical file and adds both `text` and `origin`. `from-src` stores its `fs-path` argument unchanged, so a raw Nix path produces a path-typed `origin` and a string produces a string-typed one. That `origin` is the file's last physical location, tracking provenance independently of the node's key path; [is-leaf](../src/vfs/node-cond.nix) accepts either a path or a string. [`dir.from-src`](../src/vfs/dir/from-src.nix) imports every physical file below a directory at its relative VFS path and combines the one-file trees with `recursive.no-collision`.

## Assemble first, interpret later

Construction and semantic interpretation are separate stages. `from-src` is one way to populate a VFS, not the owner of the later lifecycle. A caller can assemble one tree from several physical directories, individual files, and leaves generated in Nix expressions. Generated leaves can hold design-system partials or other artifacts that do not exist in any source directory.

For example, the VFS-aware merge resolver described in [attrs-merge.md](attrs-merge.md) can combine several imported trees with a generated file:

```nix
sundry.attrs.merge.directories.no-collision [
  (sundry.vfs.dir.from-src source-a)
  (sundry.vfs.dir.from-src source-b)
  (sundry.vfs.file.from-text
    ["components{kind:partial}" "_tokens.scss"]
    generated-tokens)
]
```

Run `resolve-tags` after assembly so every source follows the same logical-path and tag rules. Keep `load-nix` as a separate stage because importability is a property of an individual leaf: physical leaves can have `origin`, while generated text leaves do not have one unless they are materialized first. The caller can select the intended Nix leaves, materialize generated Nix files when necessary, and load only that subset without forcing unrelated generated files through `from-src` or `load-nix`.

## Transformation stages

| operation | input requirement | leaf fields after the operation |
|---|---|---|
| `file.from-text` | non-empty VFS path, string contents | `text` |
| `file.from-src` / `dir.from-src` | readable physical file or directory | `text`, `origin` |
| [`dir.resolve-tags`](../src/vfs/dir/resolve-tags.nix) | valid VFS tree | existing fields plus `tag-list`; logical paths are cleaned |
| [`dir.load-nix`](../src/vfs/dir/load-nix.nix) | `origin` when the import is demanded | existing fields plus `expr` |
| `dir.load-nix-with fn` | `origin` when `fn` demands the imported value | existing fields plus `expr = fn path file imported` |
| [`dir.materialize name`](../src/vfs/dir/materialize.nix) | string `text` on every consumed leaf | `text` removed, `origin` replaced with the new store path; other metadata preserved |

`resolve-tags` is explained in [tag-resolution.md](tag-resolution.md). Tag-aware selection and `*-within-tag` transformations require its `tag-list` field; they do not synthesize missing tags.

`load-nix` and `load-nix-with` visit every leaf regardless of its extension. Nix keeps `import file.origin` lazy, so a missing or invalid `origin` surfaces only when the callback or its stored `expr` demands the import. Select the intended files before loading when the tree also contains non-Nix files.

`materialize` returns two related values:

```text
{
  drv = derivation containing all materialized files and their parent directories;
  dir = VFS index whose leaf origins point inside drv;
}
```

Returning this attrset does not yet check every leaf. Demanding `result.drv`, or a materialized leaf `origin` that refers to it, deeply forces the collected `{ path, text }` records before constructing the derivation. Other metadata such as `expr` is preserved without being part of that materialization check.

Continue VFS transformations through `result.dir`; use `result.drv` when a build input needs the physical file tree. Materialization deliberately drops `text` so memory contents cannot drift from the materialized file. A materialized `dir` cannot be materialized again without restoring `text`.

## Traversal boundary

`sundry.vfs.dir.{walk, collapse, reform, filter, path-strs}` use `sundry.vfs.is-leaf-node` as the generic traversal `halt`. They recurse through directories, expose complete leaves to callbacks, and report demanded malformed children with their path. The root attrset remains the directory container and is not passed to `halt`.

See [attrs-traversal.md](attrs-traversal.md) for callback variants and the different strictness of `walk`, `collapse`, `reform`, and `filter`. Physical empty-directory behavior and structure-only validation are covered in [gotchas.md](gotchas.md).
