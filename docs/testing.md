# Testing

How tests are written and run in this library.

## Test format

Each `.nix` file under `src/` may export a `tests` attribute that is a list of two-element lists:

```nix
tests = [
  [ <actual-expression> <expected-value> ]
  ...
];
```

Tests are evaluated by [core/check-tests.nix](../core/check-tests.nix). The framework strips `tests` from the module's public exports, so it never leaks into the `mlem.*` namespace.

A single-element list `[ <value> ]` instead of `[ actual expected ]` is treated as a **debug print** — the value is rendered and shown regardless of correctness. Useful when probing behavior.

## Where tests live

Inline `tests = [...]` blocks in the source file are the default. Use them whenever the test fixture is small and self-contained (an inline attrset, a string literal, a small list).

When a test needs a multi-file on-disk fixture (the only current case is the VFS test suite), the fixture lives under [tests/vfs-test-dir/](../tests/vfs-test-dir/) and the test imports it via `mlem.vfs.dir.from-src "${flake-root}/tests/vfs-test-dir/..."`. The file-naming scheme inside the fixture is described in [test-naming.md](test-naming.md).

A separate test file (in `tests/src/`) is only justified when the same multi-file fixture needs to be exercised against a behavior that has no single owning `src/` file — see [tests/src/filtering.nix](../tests/src/filtering.nix) as the one current example.

## Running tests

```bash
bash eval-result.sh
```

Returns a Nix list of failing test reports. Empty list `[ ]` means all pass.

Each failure is formatted as a side-by-side `expected` vs `got` table with the source file path.

## Edge case coverage

The expected coverage per function:

1. **Happy path** — the function applied to a representative input.
2. **Obvious edges** — empty input, identity/no-op, boundary values, formal errors (when catchable). Only add what's *obviously* missing; do not invent exotica.
3. **Documented failure modes** — when a function throws on misuse and the throw is reachable via `tryEval`, add a `tryEval` test to lock the contract in.

What does *not* warrant a test: alternative spellings of the happy path that don't exercise a new branch; property-based variants beyond what the implementation actually branches on.

## `tryEval` does not catch everything

`builtins.tryEval` catches only `throw` and `abort`. It does **not** catch Nix evaluator errors raised by built-ins, such as:

- `builtins.head []`, `builtins.tail []`, `builtins.elemAt list i` out of range
- `attrs.${missing-key}`, `lib.getAttrFromPath` on a non-existent path
- type mismatches at the C-implementation level

If a function's edge case hits one of those (e.g. `excl-head []` calls `lib.head []` internally), the case **cannot** be expressed as a test — wrapping in `tryEval` re-throws an uncatchable error and the whole suite blows up. Either rewrite the function to `throw` explicitly on the bad input, or accept that the case is undefined behavior and leave it out.
